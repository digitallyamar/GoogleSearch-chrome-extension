I want to build a new chrome extension that I can use on brave browser. The extension 
should allow me to right click on any select words in a webpage and provide me with an
option that will allow me to search these selected words on google.com. This 
functionality already works on Chrome browser builtin, but it has been modified to 
search on brave search engine when right clicked to search on brave browser. So I want
to add Google search option as well. Let me know if you are not clear on my 
requirement and I can explain better if required.
